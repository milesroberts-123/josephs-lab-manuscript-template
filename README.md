# Josephs Lab Manuscript Template

Author: Miles Roberts*

*I made this template by using the biorxiv preprint latex template and making modifications.

## How to use

Copy all of the files in this repo into overleaf and use the prompts in each `.tex` file as a guide. As a general overview:

`main.tex` contains the main text of the manuscript

`supplement.tex` contains supplementary figures, methods, etc.

`reviews.tex` is a template for writing responses to reviewer comments

`cover.tex` is a simple template for writing a cover letter.

`figures/` contains separate folders for main figures and supplementary figures

You can replace `Josephs_transparent.png` with your own lab logo if you wish.
